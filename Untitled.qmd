## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave *together content* and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about [Quarto](https://quarto.org) see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:


``` r
2 + 2
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
x
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). The mean of mpg is `r round(x,1)`.
